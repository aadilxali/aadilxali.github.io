## Reflections & Learnings
### Success & Growth
**What am I most proud of personally and professionally?**
- everytime I ship something to the world - the launch on PH, the blog posts, 40 line tech bro twitter bot all feel the most satisfying, getting into DD, Minerva, MFC, Enlite - none of those felt satisfing since it was me coasting off previous clout/previous ships

**What new skills and/or habits did I develop?**
- booTSTRAP
- learned some stuff about computer hardware from nand2tetris
- came onto another level socially what with twitter, cassia and being tossed into DD and forced to make friends (although I still am not as charming or as confident or good at reading people as I'd like to be)
- rock climbing, poker, catan, cooking, board games
- I guess I learned some ruby and sql but that felt like nothing

**What were the biggest obstacles I overcame?**
- I felt pretty emotionally crippled at times - dealing with the pain of people moving away sucked, the anxiety of getting into uni with what felt like not good enough grades sucked, not being able to go outisde and meet friends bc of Covid really sucked, loneliness and lack of love sucked - this years expected productivity felt much higher than actual productivity and not meeting that sucked, the goal felt like waiting things out and surviving rather than thriving a lot of the time

**How am I different?**
- better socially, more aware, better at reaching out (especially online)
- have experienced more pain and loneliness and anxiety (didn't know what anxiety was til this year)
- honestly I feel like I was more ambitious/stupid before and that part of me is waning now

### Falling Short
**What goals didn't I accomplish? What got in the way?**
- didn't set goals but I thought I'd be a much better coder by now
- I also thought I'd be much more phsyically fit, thought I'd get to keep up the gym grind and rock climd more but that didn't happen


**What do I wish I accomplished?**
- whatever I didn't accomplish + reading more, making more/stronger friendships and moving out

**What habits or interests held me back?**
- spend so much time on my phone/browsingscoial media or watching tv - normally to get around that I work at a new location
- getting money/financial security really let me be complacent, I was kind of like "I have more money than most people my age what do I have left to accomplish" (this is also not true compared to people I met this year)

### People & Relationships
**Which relationships have been the most fulfilling?**
- my 2 closest friends would be Liam and Cassia, just always have good talks with them and we've gotten to the point where even if we don't talk it feels like the love is still there (especially with Liam)
- love the enlite and mfc community, feels like the second time I've found my people, first being TKS

**Which relationships have been the most draining?**
- the people from TKS that can't read my mind/ asking how each other's doing is how we talk to each other, we're just there because the realationship is somewhat useful rather than enjoyable
- honestly my relationship with Cassia sometimes after she moved to montral, too hard to be friend swith her over the internet/when I'm not on her mind/in frequent contact, feels like the telepathy is gone

**When did I feel most connected or most alone in relationships?**
- most connected -> WNRS and cottage w/ Cassia, Liam's going away party with Liam and Brianna, late night calls with Sarv
- most alone -> when Cassia went to Utah/Montreal, talking to DD people in groups or during work calls

### Health & Wellness
**What activities supported or degraded my health?**
- support: frankoman, stretching, chiro, taking walks, reading/taking screen breaks, shipping and habit setting with cue card(did these infrequently)
- degrade: sleeping late/poorly, spending time on netflix, checking social medias in rotation, lying in bed on my phone

**When was I at peace, satisfied, or content?**
- walking through lisbon, reading in parks, chilling with cassia and liam in parks, family get togethers
**When did I feel the most alert and energetic?**
- felt super alert after some light sleep deprivation and coding at night for training path/making gpt3 bot/writing, most real energy when socializing in lisbon or at hackathon with aryan

**When did I feel the most tired, or in discomfort or pain?**
- pain when lonely, tired when sleeping for less than 7.5(more like 9) hours, discomfort when not stretching or working out physically

### Lessons & Themes
**What were my top lessons learned?**
- everyone wants to talk and is amicable when you reach out but no one wants to reach out first
- can't let the pain of loss keep me from letting myself be vulnerable and experiencing love completely
- getting in motion and having no zero days is key

**How do you describe this year in 3-5 keywords?**
- anxiety, lonely, love, escape, outlier 

**What am I most thankful for?**
- glad I have friends I can really talk to and excited that I'll get to meet more of my people in the next couple of years

## Current Life Assessment
- Score your level of satisfaction in each area of life from 1 to 10

### Health
**How does your body and mind feel?**
- 4, want to get stronger and more flexible, mind is just starting to become emotionally aware from talking to Cassia and spending time alone

### Family & Friends
**How do you feel about the quality of relationships in your life?**
- 7, friends are great and excited to travel and meet more of them in person, family's been good for a while it's much easier to talk to them now than it was a year or 2 ago

### Love
**How do you feel about romance in your life?**
- 0, nonexistant but I feel like I'm more ready for a relationship than ever, just really really hard with covid

### Money
**How do you feel about your financial situation?**
- 10, really good what with DD + my investments, not worried at all
	
### Career
**How do you feel about work and your career trajectory?**
- 7, could def work at shopify after grad easily but I wan tto do some good for the world and work harder and on more interesting projects than ecomm at Shopify

### Spirituality
**Are you connected to something bigger and greater than yourself?**
- 0, no not at all, this is a really underserved area of myself and I gave up meditation and religion, might make this more of a focus as I travel, make more friends, take tdrugs and become more worldly

### Personal Growth
**How much time do you invest in self-improvement?**
- 4, probably around 5-10 hours a week, easy to inflate if I could all the small things like reading and coding but I haven't done much dedicated practice to anything this year

### Fun
**How much time do you devote to recreation and fun?**
- 7, see I dedicate a lot of time to social media and netflix and video games bu tthat's not really fun, it's like watered down fun - I want to truly do fun things then truly do nothing and chill then truly work rather than having a distracted mind that is occupied by my colorful pocket box all the time

### Technology
**How does technology play a role in your life?**
- 10, my entire life revolves around tech I spend almost all my waking hours on tech, my job and school are online, my friends are online, my recreation is online - I hate it I want to get away to a cabin in the woord swith some friends and play board games and go on a bender
	
### Environment
**How do you feel about your physical environment?**
- 4, I've been trapped in pretty much just my room forever with little sunlight and it's not bad I spent most of high school in here but the fact that I can't leave kills me a little, I've gone numb to deal with it but I wan tto move my body more and experience the outdoors and go to coffee shops and parks etc again
	
### Reflections
**How do I feel about my life when I look at the areas of life above?**
- 5, my life is very average I feel, I have very few goals I'm pursuing just a lot of vague explorations of tech and reading sometimes and a lot of phone/netflix/videogames and I just feel useless - I feel good at work because I have something concrete to do and I think I'm a good worker, almost a workoholic when I have something to do but in a completely unstructured env. like I'm in right now I just feel useless and I'm not moving
- tiny habits are helping but I'm just not getting better socially, intellectually or physically like I'd like to

**Which 2-3 dimensions do I want to focus on in 2021? **
- physically - STRONGER, more flexible, more energy, better sleep
- rather than coasting off of humor, being impressive based off of what I'm working on/intellectually
