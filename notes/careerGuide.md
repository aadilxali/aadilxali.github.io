## Personal Productivity
- Don't keep a schedule, do what's most interesting at the time (if you don't like it, don't do it)
	- Distinguish between **must-do** and **sounds interesting but...**
- Keep 3 lists:
	- Must-do: organized by timeframe
	- Watch: anything that isn't really a task but needs to be attended to ex. follow ups, reminders
	- Later: to do when you have time or ish you could

- Write 3-5 to-dos on an index card everyday, keep an anti to-do list on the back for anything useful you did, tear it up at EoD

- Structured procrastination: While avoiding the main thing you have to do, do other tasks that aren't as high priority
- Use email only at the start and end of the workday, finish each of those with an empty inbox
	- File anything to follow up on under *Pending*, things to read later under *Review* and archive everything else
- Eat a real breakfast
- Only say yes to things that give you a little adrenaline spike
- Do. Something. You. Love.


## Part 1: Opportunity
- Focus on developing skills and pursuing opps. rather than pin-pointing outcomes
- Each opp. you take has a certain risk and return&mdash; some opps will have more risk but more return, others much less
	- Pursuing opps. depends on stage of life and personal risk profile ex. deferring uni to do a startup is a risk with hedging&mdash; you'd likely try harder at that startup if you knew it was your only option
	- If possible, take more income risk in exchange for skills and experiences
	- Risking something you're unhappy doing is almost always worth it
	- Working at a big company usually risks fast growth (compared to startups)

## Part 2: Skills and Education
- Develop skills that are useful in the real world ASAP&mdash; engineering and hard science degrees do this
- Don't worry about being a small fish in a big pond&mdash; aim to be in the best pond possible
	- This goes for schools and internships/co-ops
- Either be the best at 1 thing or top 25% at more than 2 things
	- Make one of these things communication, written or verbal
	- Management: work for a great manager early on then ask for responsibility for a team of people
	- Sales: getting people to do what you want reliably when offering something they should want
	- Finance:
		- Financial theory, understanding financial statements, budgeting and planning, corporate structure, how equity and debt markets work
		- Go find a finance person and offer to teach her all about software in return for her teaching you all about finance
		- Make an investment in yourself by reading the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal every day. Read two papers cover to cover for five years and you'll know a lot of what you need to know. (Except for the Journals op-eds.)
	- Get international experience, especially in fast growing market economies
	- It's dangerous to get to the real world without having really challenged yourself/taken any risks/experienced public failure and humiliation

## Part 3: Where to go and why
- Industries where the founders of the industry/companies are still actively involved
- When tech and finance get old, there's room for innovation
- Go to where the action/change/growth is happening, be it startup, team, company or city
- "Learn everything you can about the business and the industry in which you find yourself"
	- How would I start a firm like this today?
	- If I were starting a company in this industry today, how would it be different than this firm?
	- Why is this firm and other firms in this industry doing what they do?
	- What are the assumptions underneath their behavior?
	- Should those assumptions be changing?
	- How might this industry work differently?
	- Which customers are being underserved?
	- What new technologies might change things completely?
	- How were things working 10 years ago, versus today, versus 10 years from now?
	- **If the creators of this industry were starting out today, what would they be doing now?**
