### Out of Pocket Email Newsletter - Video Games x Health Care
- thinking of tranditional industries as video games
	- community mods (ex. in healthcare: DIY insulin pumps, in finance: wealthsimple with their graphs and showing how fan an initial contributon will to in 40 years)
	- allowing people to flex on each other (ex. showing miles traveled or routes on strava, memes on tech twitter but this might be more of a status 'game')
	- time sensitive special events (ex. people usually make a point to get flu shots/ know about flu 'season')

### Eric Torenberg Newsletter - Starting a company is less risky than you think
- starting a company is a hard thing and trying it gives you clout, much more than if you joined a startup that failed
- it also teaches you a lot - when you can take financial risk, think about either joining somewhere that'll build your network and learn a lot, making it easier for you to start something later or start a company outright - the learning and networking will happen there too and the clout will carry over to your next venture

### Alexey Guzey - Why have a blog
- things to write about:
	- advice you repeatedly give to your friends
	- sharing personal exp. others may find useful
	- ideas about something you read/disagreed with
	- sharing ideas with friends via DM that might be useful to others
	- investigations/ going down rabbit holes
	- private collections/lists of things I find cool
	- art/poems/memes/statements/satire
- tell people you meet what you write about
> "You can read all the self-help books in the world. You can read all the blog posts in the world. It’s not enough. Good thinking doesn’t happen by passive osmosis of other people’s good thinking. You have to actually write essays and journals to debug yourself and your ideas. And then, crucially, act on this thinking."
- even if its unoriginal, write to explain in a way that hasn't been tried before or to form connections/spark ideas that didn't easily arise from the first writing - combining and distilling ideas is valuable

### Alexy Guzey - Friendship
- true friendship:
> No matter how long you spend apart, when you come back with your friend, it is like no time has passed at all. You may have experienced meeting someone from a past association—a school friend or a work friend—and upon re-meeting them, realize that without the common, mutual experience that there’s nothing there anymore. A true friend, however, reconnects easily and instantly.
> I used to think I disliked social interaction. I have since realized – and it blew my mind – that I only disliked social interaction with people who aren’t awesome.

### Alexey Guzey - Advice
- If you’re giving advice, it’s helpful to spend an hour or more to :

1. make sure that the person cares about solving the problem in the first place (rather than just venting, feeling obliged to want to solve the problem…)
2. make sure that the person does not have psychological blocks around doing anything about the problem (anxiety, learned helplessness) or figure out how to work around them
3. make sure that the person’s internal traits and ambitions match the thing you’re suggesting
- people generate systematically wrong explanations for their behavior and they will give you systematically bad advice if they reason from wrong explanations from their behavior

### The Hacker Who Saved The Internet - Wired
- Marcus Hutchins messed around with computers as a kid, learned how to write scripts in MS word, got into hacker forums and lurked for a while then made his own stuff, eventually contracted to write software to attack others and got paid a portion of proceeds in bitcoin, got so obsessed he ignored his family, food, outside world
- Kronos was one particularly bad piece of software he wrote, had morals so didn't write the web injects part of the software but got screwed so he had to put it in the final thing when someone else wrote it and maintain it, succumbed to sunk cost and wanting to get paid for his work, was pretty lenient with giving out personal details
- guilt of getting caught depressed him, took lots of drugs
- some ransomware was corrupting the data of old computers, he ran it on a quarantined/controlled virtual machine and saw it posted to a weird url, registering that url was like the kill switch for it, basically saved banks and hospitals billions and worked constantly to keep that url up
- got caught by the FBI basically because he gave out personal info to a sketchy hacker buddy online, had the hacker community support him and donate to him since he was a legend for savng the interner basically from the ransomware virus (Wormcry)
- judge let him go because the good he did karmically outweighed the malicious software he built (Kronos)
- guilt still eats away at him
